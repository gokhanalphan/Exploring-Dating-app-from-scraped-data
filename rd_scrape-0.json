{"text": "\n    I have not. I have found that when one party rejects the other for a relationship, it\u2019s unlikely that the rejected person will truly be interested in a platonic friendship.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yes, well I don't know if it will last but so far it has. One guy I met had this amazing golden retriever energy, just fantastically fun. We had a blast snowboarding together, I let him crash with me after being extremely clear it was a crash not a smash offer. He was respectful. We made out a little bit over the next few times I saw him but didn't have sex. I was out of town for awhile and started dating someone else. We had planned to ride again with his staying with me but I told him I couldn't have him stay with me. He asked why, I told him I was seeing someone and he was super cool about it. We still ride together and have a blast, it hasn't been weird and I feel like we're going to stay legitimate friends. I think this only works because while we both had a blast and found each other attractive neither of us was super invested in dating each other and we didn't have sex.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I met a guy on a dating app who I've now known for 4.5 years. We dated for about 6 weeks of that time (oddly, those 6 weeks were in roughly the middle of those 4.5 years, not at the beginning) and we continue to be friends today. I should point out that I've been using dating apps for around a decade and this is the only friendship that's ever come out of it.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Nope. I've found "},
{"text": "\n    Over 10 years ago, I met my late wife on the old version of OkCupid.  Originally she was just a chat buddy and we never intended to meet because she lived almost 200 miles away and was 8 years younger than me.  Circumstances conspired to have us eventually meet, and even when we tried to just be friends we ended up dating and then moving in together.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Before her, I met and dated several women through the old OKC in my own area without ever really connecting with anyone.  During that time, I was very active on the OKCupid message boards or forums of the time. I met a lot of people by socializing on there.  I eventually met several of them, even ones that lived on the other side of the country miles away at one point.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    To this day, I maintain social media and chat friendships with some of those friends from OkCupid, even though I never met some of them in person.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Now that I look at dating and how much it's evolved in the years since then, I'm a bit at a loss. Everything is swipe left, swipe right, focusing purely on pictures instead of personality and communication.  I've read up a bit on it, and the general advice is to effectively get a makeover and hire a professional photographer to take good pictures of you for your profile so that people will swipe right on you and then maybe actually read your profile, otherwise you're not going to get even a foot in the door.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Personally, I live in a small town with an insignificant singles population.  We moved here because it was a good place to raise a family.  Since moving here, my wife fell ill to cancer and passed, and my own health has declined to where I'm disabled and have limited opportunities to travel.  Having covid isolation thrown into the mix has made it that much easier for me to just not really consider trying to meet people or date.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I've looked at various apps and services online, but it's pretty pointless because there just aren't really any single women in my area near my own age.  I haven't run across any platforms that allows the type of socializing that I was used to either.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I\u2019m sorry about your wife. Old school OkCupid was such a different experience. It\u2019s that \u201cold internet\u201d that I miss so much. Sadly, now that everything has gotten so shallow and surface level, I don\u2019t see it ever going back to real profiles and actually getting to know people \ud83d\ude22\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Actually, yes I have! It was on Tinder! I matched with a cop In my area and even though There was an attraction there between the two of us we just didn\u2019t align that well together. We met 3 years again and now he\u2019s one of my closest friends. He\u2019s married now and I\u2019ve been in a serious long term relationship.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Generalizations incoming...\n  "},
{"text": "\n    This has been SUPER common for me with women in the LGBT+ community, as a bi woman.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    With men? Almost non-existent, outside of friends "},
{"text": "\n    I've also seen this way more common in certain subcultures like LGBT+, kink, poly, etc. The \"pool\" of people is a lot smaller, so even if you don't click romantically it's still nice to have friends who are part of your niche.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yes! I have multiple friends that I initially met through one of the apps.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    True friendships no. I tried to be friends with one and it backfired on me. I loved talking to him so reconnected thru dinner. He straight up asked me why I stopped dating him as I was taking a bite out of a burger. I thought I provided a respectful response and the conversation moved on. He ended the meal by hugging me and asking me to go visit a local attraction with him the coming up weekend. I was so excited to be doing something with someone outside of family!! It was a total revenge move on his part and I got ghosted lol\n  "},
{"text": "\n    That\u2019s horrifying\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yes, but it was a while ago.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I dated my friend J for about 2 months after meeting on OKCupid approximately 10 years ago. Since then we've remained friends and she is one of my very closest friends. She was the witness at my wedding when I got married and has helped me navigate my divorce when it broke down.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    We weren't suited romantically but something in the OKCupid algorithm was right about our compatibility otherwise. However, the way it works now is totally different - an app didn't even exist when we met - and I'm unsure that these match percentages are anywhere near as accurate/reflective as they used to be.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    ETA: might be worth noting that as a lesbian, it's a fairly common and true stereotype to be friends with your exes. So worth noting that in my experience.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Everyone who could intellectually take a step back and think she had the qualities to be a good friend I was interested in dating. At this point in my life, a boundary I have is to not be friends with women I want to date, so even if there is some friendship potential as well, I decline being friends in those cases.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I currently have a \"friendship\" with one woman I've met on OLD, but part of me wonders if she still thinks we may end up as more.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Every other woman I've met on OLD and tried to be friends with has been a bust.  Either faded, ghosted, or worse, an unhealthy dynamic.  I've had healthy friendships with women I've met on things other than OLD (even if we tried dating/fooling around and then stopped), but not the ones from OLD.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yeah same. Eventually the friendship fades, or the girl just ghosts one day. Usually when they get a boyfriend. It's funny because that hasn't happened with my female friends who I met in real life.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yes with the women. They seemed far more flexible about the outcomes and were always extremely communicative, even when expressing their indecisions and angst (seriously girl, thank you but like shut up)"},
{"text": "\n    Nope, even just yesterday a date that I was optimistic about (that I mention in the rant and rave section) said that she\u2019d be up for meeting again just just as friends and I (politely) noped out of that. I wanted to date her, and still would want to. She didn\u2019t want to date me and that\u2019s OK. But deep down if I\u2019m romantically interested, it\u2019s not just going to stop subconsciously if we say \u201clet\u2019s just be friends\u201d. Wouldn\u2019t be fair to either of us.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    i've definitely made friends with men i've dated from the apps, usually started out dating and ended things on good terms or just realized you liked each other but not in a LTR kinda way. of course with exes, it's always good to have time apart after the initial breakup, but i have a handful of friends i've met on the apps that i consider pals now.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Nope. Even if things ended on the best of terms with a guy, friendship is something I\u2019m just not interested in. I have enough friends in my life, and as a parent who works full time it\u2019s hard enough making time to maintain those friendships as well as dating. I just don\u2019t have the time or the energy, or willingness really, to devote effort in cultivating a new friendship in that way.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yep!\n  "},
{"text": "\n    My best friend and I dated for 6 months or so.  Been great friends going on 7 years now.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Depends on how you define lasting friendship.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I have one ex that I exchange messages with every now and then but never actually see each other f2f\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Another ex we message more frequently and pre-pandemic would get dinner infrequently\n  "},
{"text": "\n    In my experience, most of the time it doesn't work to stay friends, I find that both parties have to resist the inclination to fall back into the old \"dating\" behaviours.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Actually I did! I went on a date with this guy we previously chatted and talked on the phone for two weeks I thinkso the connection was already established. We both had a lovely time and after the date he said he's not looking for a gf and he's not really for a relationship but he would love for us to be friends. That was four years ago and he is one of my closes friends and wise versa. I think the key here was that he genuinely was not ready to date and was actually looking for a friendship not just saying it to blow me off.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Goodness, I have a lot of male friends that I had dated in the past!  I\u2019ve been divorced and dating for a decade, and that time I\u2019ve established 8 friendships. While we started off as breadcrumbing after a few dates, it\u2019s turned into sharing important events in life. Helping each other with computer issues, home improvements, elderly parents, and sewing masks. Haha. We do not have sex, but definitely check in weekly.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    What I ponder, is how none of them have had a relationship in the past 10 years, either. And how we can get along so well personality-wise, but they didn\u2019t want to date or marry me.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yep. Two lovely ladies. One of them has become a good friend and we travel to see each other sometimes. The other I still hang out with and we do a lot of cooking.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Of course there's still a bunch of people who ghosted me, but that's the risk you take with online dating.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    So i went of a few dates with a lovely lass as I was coming out of a really bad situation.  I thought I was fine but it was actually while trying to date this new person I realized I was incorrect, I was still messed up and not really in a position to date.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Since then I've become somewhat friends with the new person. I no longer live in the same city but we both travel a lot so we've caught up when we are both in the same city.  She's a pretty awesome person so though I was 100% not ready to date her when we met I definitely wanted to stay in touch.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Shit i did made frieds i think i am doing it all wrong\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Oh yes I have! I have three guy friends I've met from off the dating apps that I am still friends with today. Oldest friendship is about 9 years. Then 5 and 3. All of them I only had one date with and actually, the 9 years friendship one I was genuinely looking for male friendships cause I was with an ex at the time so we never actually went on a date. None of these guy friends ever went beyond platonic.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I normally sense right away if someone is suitable for a friendship or not. Then I extend the olive branch if they would like to continue by being friends. I've had a couple of others that agreed to be friends where we hung out a couple of more times but it wasn't too strong and we just now mutual Facebook friends (both married).\n  "},
{"text": "\n    My girlfriends always find it fascinating I've been able to convert dates into friends but I have an outgoing and extroverted personality. And I always value getting to know people and friendships. I can generally sense if a guy would be the type of person that can have a friendship, without overstepping it.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yeah, not in the sense of we hang out every day and talk a whole lot, mostly because they live in different countries, but there's at least 4 guys I've met through Tinder that I consider friends and still talk to every now and then and would meet up with if they're in the area, in the same way as I do with other friends I've met traveling.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    And there's some around here that I have on social media and talk to every now and then and we're always happy to see each other if we run into each other.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I have on Tinder but they only really lasted until I got engaged (to someone also met on Tinder). We were friends because we had something in common: single during lockdown. But once lockdown ends and people find partners elsewhere, it gets harder and harder to find common ground. A lot of the final messages I have from Tinder friends are them congratulating me on my engagement. And a couple Tinder friends I had to end things because they were more like \u201cThis isn\u2019t the girl for you. You are making a mistake\u2026.\u201d\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yes, I have! I was FWB with one for a few months, told him I wanted to stop that, and we\u2019ve been just friends for 5 or 6 years now. I\u2019m really close friends with one of his ex girlfriends and I hang out with his current girlfriend too. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s at all feasible for most people, but he\u2019s in the whole poly/open relationship scene. His partners knew how we met, knew that we were absolutely not interested in any sexual or romantic dynamic happening again, and I think because of that + their existing relationship dynamics, it\u2019s been easier to keep that friendship.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I have another friend who I met but never got romantic/sexual with that I hung out with consistently when we lived in the same city, and I still chat with him weekly. His girlfriend knows how we met and also is fine with it.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I have several other people I\u2019m pretty friendly with but not close to, if that makes sense. Like we\u2019ll grab a random drink or go on a night out together within a shared social circle, but I don\u2019t call them to talk about my feelings.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I think the difficult thing about using a dating app like a friendship app is that 1) both parties have to be totally ok with friendship. It sucks to have someone catch feelings and become slowly resentful if they aren\u2019t able to accept that something more won\u2019t happen 2) if and when one of you gets an romantic partner and asks how y\u2019all met, there is a potential for friction that isn\u2019t there for like \u2018through work!\u2019 or \u2018we met at so and so\u2019s party and hit it off!\u2019 Despite rationally knowing there wasn\u2019t any romantic involvement, the initial base for the friendship may trigger some emotions that could lead to your friendship fizzling.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I\u2019d probably just use bumble BFF or be pretty flexible on what friendship would look like + disclose you want to be friends as soon as you know it\u2019s not going to be romantic/sexual between you and the person you\u2019re matching with.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Love this answer. Once you get to know someone, you know them deeply. The connection cannot be severed until one or both decide to cut the cord. I believe there is a different level of human intelligence at work. I decided to not date about a year ago coming out of 2+ years of polyamory so I could concentrate on trauma healing. I let all my partners know. They\u2019re still there, just not in the same capacity. But they hold me silently, with love and care. This business we carry on with in life where it\u2019s either a relationship or it\u2019s not, it\u2019s bullshit. It\u2019s a lie. Love who you want to love when you want to love them. Communicate openly. The rest will figure itself out.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yes but we dated for 1.5 years. She\u2019s still my best and closest friend to this day.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yes! I met a guy through OLD, we went on first date, he liked me more than I like him, I friend zoned him, but he seemed to have a good time with me. The relationship grew and we became more than friENDS. We cared for each other and we were together for a while. We are from two different cultures. He is the typical indian software enginner and I am latina. Somehpw we took a different direction. I found a bf and he got married. We still stay in touch through messages and I know we both really care for each other. I would say it is possible! I want to add we have know each other for almost 10 years!\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I'm still new to dating and I'm non-binary demi, and I explicitly put on my profile, \"Looking for new people to connect with and do things as friends with potential to grow.\" And my matches have been similarly friendly. There's a fair amount of people in my suggested matches who aren't looking for a relationship either. We're working on ourselves, busy with life, not into integrating ourselves with another yet. Atm I have several new friendships forming. And being demisexual I need that friendship to form to ever be attracted to anyone romantically anyway so, it works out. And if I stay in the friendzone after X amount of time and I catch feelings, oh well. I have a friend still, I can let the feelings go. :)\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I have a good story for this one. The answer is yes, it happened only once but it happened. I matched with this girl and we hit it off really nicely, we seemed very compatible and we set a date. Unfortunately, while texting before the date, we realized we had an incompatibility which was a deal breaker for me. We said farewell after that conversation and I thought that would have been just another dead end. Instead, one night we met at the theatre, she approached me and we had a very pleasant chat. We decided to go for dinner together afterwards, in a very spontaneous way, and we decided to keep in touch as friends. And we are still very good friends to this very day! So yeah, it's rare but it can happen :D\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yes, once. I went on a couple dates with a woman I met on Tinder once and wasn\u2019t feeling it. She asked if we could still be friends and I said ok. Being friends with her has been fine years later and she even became friends with some of my other friends. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you should try to force though.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Three of my friends... new country during Covid so friendship was scarce. Though one is acting salty that I have a bf now. Mainly online friends. Text between daily and weekly. But meet up once every few months for a catch up.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    All at least 1 year old. Oldest nearing 3 years.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Don\u2019t use OLD for friendship though... these three were because we liked similar hobbies or have similar ideas but emotionally we didn\u2019t match and one his family didn\u2019t approve of him dating a white girl. I have dated much more in this time and only had a relationship with one of those three.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    In a roundabout way, yes. I became friends with my boyfriend's friends, and when our relationship ended, I continued to hang out with some of his friends. I'm still in touch with him too, but only very infrequently and not really with the intention of developing a friendship.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yupp! One of my best friends is from a dating app. We kissed once many years ago but that\u2019s it. I know it\u2019s rare but I\u2019m happy it worked out!\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I have, but I think it's WAY harder to do once you're past 30. I don't really suggest it to the people I go on dates with anymore the way I used to if a date didn't work out in my 20s but the person seemed cool. Nowadays it's only happened with people I've gone on at least several dates with so that we had a bit of a cadence already.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I think it's really more of something you do in your 20s as well because you're more likely to be new to a place and not have an existing friend group.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I could see if you had a niche interest like rock climbing, it might make more sense.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Most of the time though I think it's good to focus on one thing - romance - if a friendship "},
{"text": "\n    I don\u2019t use dating apps, but I absolutely have here on Reddit. Guys and girls, I\u2019ve had dinner with a few, gamed, went hiking, seen movies, etc..\n  "},
{"text": "\n    You can find good people anywhere if you\u2019re open to it.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yes, several times. When there hasn't been strong mutual attraction but we are having fun, things often develop naturally towards friendship.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    OK Cupid used to support this really well, because you could simultaneously be looking for a wide variety of different kinds of relationships, and you didn't need to pigeonhole someone before even meeting them.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I miss the old OK Cupid and the culture around it... \ud83d\ude14\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I've (M) have made a few friends (F). Wasn't my intention but they were good people and we either didn't have a romantic connection or the distance/circumstances prevented us from dating each other.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    \"if they do it becomes a temporary friendship that slowly fades or completely disappears once they find the relationship they were looking for\"\n  "},
{"text": "\n    It is the case for me, a woman that I would speak on the fone everyday and we told our lives to one another. I didn't want to date her, not my type really and she had two children. But eventually she found a boyfriend and got married. I saw everything on instagram and liked her pictures, happy for her. But, off course, the friendship ended as soon as she got the boyfriend.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yeah.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I have a good friend of about 16 years I met on POF way back. We used to hook up but as we grew up, we just stayed friends. We fight like an old married couple now but we've always kept in touch and see each other a couple times a year for lunch.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I have made a few other friends too but we aren't as close or stay in contact as long. Most fade out or are short lived. I'd say I have maybe 5 friends I met drom dating apps that were not of romantic interest after we met and became friends instead. Whether they know thats how I felt, not sure but they don't seem to mind and are dating other people.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Um as a guy I have tried this but the girls never follow up or they just keep me as a pen pal when they need advice or somthing.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    But just my experience\n  "},
{"text": "\n    no. i\u2019m friends with a couple exes that i met on dating apps, and back when tinder had the \u201ctinder social\u201d feature we used that to make friends, but otherwise no. it is always weird for the person who is friend zoned to hear about the other person\u2019s dates and new relationships. do not use a dating app to try to make friends.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I did for a few months but the friendship did eventually fade. Nothing happened, just gradually stopped talking and hanging out.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Though I was sad the friendship faded, I did enjoy the ability to get to know someone slowly and having it not be romantic from the jump. It felt like we were naturally feeling each other out and not jumping straight into romance (which has often been my experience with OLD). I decided to adopt a slower mindset more intentionally the last time I was on a dating app and met up with a guy. I communicated my approach with him and he seemed uninterested in a relationship if it wasn't strictly dating. I completely understand that but it did kind of bum me out. IMO, there's still something really enjoyable about being open to meeting new people, possibly being friends, and then possibly more.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I\u2019ve suggested it to women I\u2019ve dated/met up with in the past on OLD, but it never led to any sustained friendship.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    My thought was that even if we didn\u2019t end up having romantic chemistry in person, we had enough in common otherwise to hang out.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Understandable though, I feel like the portion of the OLD population that is open to friendship is pretty small. Separating that mentality on an app that is meant for romantic dating is a fairly hefty proposition for a lot of people.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I've never made a lasting friendship with someone that I dated and then we turned out to be better as friends, if that's what you mean.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I've met a few people off of dating apps as friends and then we continued into a successful friendship. neither of us met with any other expectations other than to be friends. no secret desires to end up sleeping together etc. I think finding that is probably rare, since most people are not on dating apps to find friends.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yes. A casual thing I had with a guy a few years ago, we're now roommates. We were just friends for about 18 months in between, lots of common interests. It's occasionally gotten a bit weird, especially when we bring up dating and we'll say \"well it wasn't like that when...\" Or something, but it's never uncomfortable\n  "},

We had this going on for about two-three months, talking with each other almost every day, her coming over every week to watch Bachelor in Paradise/Bachelor GOAT specials and me coming to her neighborhood from time to time, sharing almost everything that friends would do, even our own respective dating journeys.\n  "},

That is until I shared another dating failure and she blew up on me. After a week of silence, she did admit that she developed feelings for me over time, despite the fact that we agreed that nothing would develop beyond friendship because of our long-term incompatibility. We decided to separate right after having that talk.\n  "},

The only thing is I\u2019m in America and he\u2019s in England (it was a worldwide mbti dating app called Boo), but I did meet him when I visited England last Fall and we hung out twice. Nothing romantic or sexual, just good friends!!\n  "},

After 2 months, on the timing of \u201cso are we dating?\u201d he accepted a job offer in MA (we were in IL) and was moving in two months, and we decided not pursuing a LDR but remaining friends. One month after he told me that I moved to CA, and he even drove me to the airport. Later that year he went to CA for work and we hung out as friends. Idk about him but I was legitimately seeing him as a good friend at that point.  This was in 2017, I am back home and we still talk as friends\n  "},

Being on the other side of it all, we love each other (platonically) to pieces, but holy hell it took a lot of work and isn't for the faint of heart.

Like that\u2019s obviously why most people are there, it\u2019s still a dating app. And as a guy who only gets a match maybe once or twice a month, to be then told they only want a friend feels a little like a bait and switch and 9 out of 10 times I stop talking to them because that\u2019s not what I\u2019m here for.\n  "},

We had maybe 4 dates and made out once or twice and things just sort of fizzled. But then we kept running into each other like at concerts and stuff. And we had tons in common... mostly music and entertainment interests. So we have occasionally gotten together again. We've been to a few concerts together. He came over and watched some new episodes of a TV show we both liked. I went to a house party he had. Not a super important friendship, but it's there nonetheless. He's a good dude.\n  "},

Instant banter, comfortable around each other, just an easiness I'd never experienced. I was obviously upset when he ended it and we didn't talk for about a month. I thought about him every day. I called him one day and we instantly said how much we missed each other in that month and he expressed how much he would like it if we could be friends but he also understood if I couldn't do that. I decided I would rather have him as a friend then nothing at all. Last month we celebrated him and his fiance having their first child together and I'm so happy I get to be a part of that with them. (Side note, his fiance is much better suited to him and I will forever be thankful that she welcomed me into her life as well) So basically, I got 2 friends and I'm an honorary aunt just because a date didn't work out. How lucky am I?!\n  "},

We\u2019ve developed quite a lovely friendship!\n  "},

She walked me to my door when dropping me off and said that she had a great time and then almost in unison we said \"but I don't feel any chemistry\". It was a v wholesome interaction and we were hiking buddies for several years after before she moved for school and then became busy with health concerns. Still talk to her through Discord and Facebook regularly.\n  "},

I dated him after a terrible ex and he was a 180 from him, which made me feel he was a guy worth keeping around. When it was ending, I was terrified of losing such a good person.

Although there were some sparks early on, I reiterated that I was not interested in a non-monogamous setup so we both re-committed to being platonic. Today it's absolutely one of my favorite friendships. We spend a lot of time together and it feels way more comfortable now that the sexual element has been removed.\n  "},

I caught up with him last week when my husband and I were visiting Vancouver for a week. Otherwise, no, any friendships that followed after datingship or relationships ended lasted maybe a year or 2 and fizzled out. Technically I'm \"friends\" with my husband's friend who inadvertently introduced us (after we went on dates, I asked to just be friends), but in the last few years, he's not been a great friend to my husband (whom he's known since middle school) and turns out is quite aggravating and annoying so idk if that's a friend-- more an acquaintance whom I went on a couple dates with years ago.\n  "},

{"text": "\n    I have made a couple of friendships. One is closer than the others. I met him on OKC a little bit less than 12 years ago. We started out seeing each other, I was more into him than he was into me, he moved away but visited the area enough that we morphed into FWB, I moved and ended up being closer to him (he was not even a factor in my decision to move) and continued FWB who don\u2019t see each other that much but talk regularly for another 3 years. He then met his now fianc\u00e9 and we transitioned to platonic friends. We backed off communication a lot for the first year or so of their relationship (she lived close to me and I didn\u2019t want to cause any issues for them, plus I had to fully get over my own feelings that had always been lingering). We then gradually regrew our platonic friendship  over the past five years and now he\u2019s one of my closest friends and the relationship is completely platonic (we have the same sense of humor and are both super competitive so that\u2019s what allows us to get along).\n  "},

Most of the time I didn\u2019t want to ask if they just wanted to be friends in case they found that insulting, but one if them it just kind of organically morphed into a friendship. We still talk a lot and became genuinely close. The other told me he was only looking fwb and asked if I was down, a said no and he asked if I wanted to be friends. We have dinner every now and again.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Honestly most of the connections I made on dating apps would have been better suited as friendships, and I wish there was a way to say that without it seeming like a consolation prize or polite rejection.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yes! I met one guy who rejected me after the first date because he wants children in the future and I\u2019m done having him. He was so respectful in that, and we\u2019d had such a good time, that I asked that we remain friends. He was new in town and came to Thanksgiving at my house that year \ud83d\ude02 He\u2019s now dating someone else but we still schedule hang time at least once per month.\n  "},

{"text": "\n    Yes I have met friends through apps and then met friends through them.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I see dating apps as just a way to meet ppl - yes most use it for dating, but I see it as people go on there and look for whatever they want- friendships, hookups, fwbs, serious relationships.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I think this might be unconventional, but I've had very long stable fwbs before I got with my current partner.  Those fwb are now just friends.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I always emphasized at the start that fwb has \"friend\" in it, meaning you are a friend even if the benefits disappear.  My previous fwbs are now just friends and I've met friends through them. We talk just like any other friends - asking advice about life, jobs, dating, etc.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I've also straight up met friends from dating apps. Would say I'm not interested for whatever reason but if they're interested in friendship then cool.  If not also cool.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    It's hard to meet new people, so I think it's great I've met people in this way. I will note that most of these friends aren't the kind of friends you see often but more \"catch up now and then\" friends. \"Send funny memes\" friends.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I met my best friend through OLD a few years ago. We dated for 3-4 months then broke up but enjoyed each other enough to continue a friendship. It has been difficult at times but we have made it work and the hard times actually bring us closer together. I value him more than most people in my life. It  can happen!\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Yup, met a woman who happened to be travelling through my town while she was living her best nomadic life. We hit it off pretty well and I went to visit her a couple of times in the random places she ended up. It wasn't meant to be but was good while it lasted. We've been in touch ever since. Nothing crazy nowadays, comments on IG photos and the occasional text session or phone call about once a month. She and her husband are planning a visit this summer and I'm looking forward to it.\n  "},

{"text": "\n    That said, its difficult to do. I\u2019ve always been someone that kept things in a dating or bust realm so they were the ones that took the initiative and persisted on the friendship at the start so I\u2019m going to say that it tends to be more at the woman\u2019s discretion than the man\u2019s.\n  "},

{"text": "\n    Surprisingly I have, with one male friend I met on Tinder. Right around the time I started chatting to him, he was dating the woman who is now his wife, so he gushed about her and it made it easier to connect on a platonic basis. I now have dinner with both of them from time to time and it's a really nice dynamic, but rare to find.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I also have a long-term female friend I met through a dating app and we had a situationship for a few months, but we weren't compatible and are much happier as friends. Overall I think these situations are more the exception than the rule, though. Right now I feel socially saturated and while I deeply value friendships, I have a hard time making room in my schedule for more.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I met my current best friend on a dating app. We dated for a short period of time, but decided we were better as friends and happily have stayed very good friends for years. We hang out several times a week haha. Also, we are opposite gender, so it is possible! But I will say, it\u2019s only happened this once. I\u2019ve made other attempts, but those friendship generally fizzle out after a couple of months.\n  "},

{"text": "\n    I treasure the friendship, but I wouldn't want to have another-and I get more everyday emotional support from my more \"regular\" type friendships. I wouldn't, for example, moan to him about getting a parking ticket, or if Tesco had substituted black grapes for green. He'd probably ask me \"what the hell I was wasting his time with?\" Similarly, I would find it grossly inappropriate if he told me all about his difficulty in finding a birthday present for his niece-or if his kitchen sink is blocked.\n  "},
