{"text": "\n    As others mentioned there are some like bumble BFF. Beware though, it's a small \"market\" because generally people don't really search for these things so there's a high probabilty of people on there who specifically search for it.

{"text": "\n    \ud83e\udd79\n  "},

{"text": "\n    Sounds like an American with a lack of a 3rd place. I'm right there with you.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    There should be one for finding D&D players\n  "},
{"text": "\n    I know some people already mentioned Bumble BFF, but as someone who has used it and found some local friends after moving cities, I highly recommend it. Yes, it does require work, as it\u2019s basically a dating app without the romantic aspect, but it works!\n  "},

{"text": "\n    Absolutely! I miss having lady talks. I had a friend at the uni with whom I was really close. Now that we are living in different cities, she has another friend. I'm stuck in a small town with nobody familiar here. I can only chat online, but I miss meeting in real life, having nice conversations, just the ladies company. My bf is also my best friend, but it's different to talk to a man, you know? So yeah, I think I just would like to have someone I could lean on, and so I could give this person the same feeling!\n  "},
{"text": "\n    2033 - A new app is developed called Friender that is designed to help our now completely social media obsessed yet perpetually lonely society develop friendships. It becomes a smash hit, soon far eclipsing any dedicated dating apps due to the sheer amount of people using it.\n  "},

{"text": "\n    There\u2019s was one app the legit advertised itself as just that on the App Store (don\u2019t remember the name) when I was in highschool and was for people under 18. Of course most people still used it for nudes and hookups and stuff like they use tinder. But I met one of my now best friends on there, at the time he would say he was straight, but since I was out publicly, he felt comfortable enough after a few months to tell me he liked guys. I encouraged him to come out to his family when he was ready, and was there every step of the way. 6 years later he has an apartment in the city with his boyfriend, and a good relationship with his family. We don\u2019t talk as often as we used to, but he will always be one of my best friends. After all, I did take care of him when he got syphilis, so there\u2019s no going back after that.\n  "},

Idk if they're down to show up why not\n  "},
{"text": "\n    There is an app called Meetup, however it's not geared towards meeting one-on-one, it's more group-oriented. You can make friends through it though.\n  "},

{"text": "\n    There is bumble BFF.  That helps find friends\n  "},
{"text": "\n    There is. Bumble has a friend setting. Just like the normal swipe left or right type of thing, but with friends.\n  "},

{"text": "\n    Or a running club.  I know these are all fitness oriented, but its a good way to kill two birds with one stone.  Little more personable than just a gym or yoga class etc where people tend to keep to themselves.\n  "},
{"text": "\n    If you\u2019re in a small town, i dont know how to help you.  People imo want to stay friend free in those places.\n  "},

{"text": "\n    The concept of tinder was basically finding a partner or date based on looks. Do you really want to find friends based on looks?\n  "},
{"text": "\n    Ofc not! But you also have a bio and interests at your disposal. But about the photos, as I've already swiped a few accounts on Bumble, I really appreciate goofy photos, especially with animals cause that helps me with this famous \"vibe check\" \ud83d\ude02 so no, photos not as a primary reason but as a nice addition!\n  "},
